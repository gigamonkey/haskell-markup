haskell-markup
==============

Haskell implementation of a Markup processing system. This is only my
second Haskell program so forgive any stupidities.  And my first using
Parsec so I may be doing that badly too.

It now passes the complete test suite I put together for my earlier
implementations as well as a bunch of tests I wrote specifically for
this one. Next up I want to figure out how to test this with
Quickcheck.
